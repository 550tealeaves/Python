# Cross-validation is a vital approach to evaluating a model. It maximizes the amount of data that is available to the model, as the model is not only trained but also tested on all of the available data.

# In this exercise, you will build a linear regression model, then use 6-fold cross-validation to assess its accuracy for predicting sales using social media advertising expenditure. You will display the individual score for each of the six-folds.

# The sales_df dataset has been split into y for the target variable, and X for the features, and preloaded for you. LinearRegression has been imported from sklearn.linear_model.





# Import the necessary modules
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold, cross_val_score

#Â Create a KFold object
kf = KFold(n_splits=6, shuffle=True, random_state=5)

reg = LinearRegression()

# Compute 6-fold cross-validation scores
cv_scores = cross_val_score(reg, X, y, cv=kf)

# Print scores
print(cv_scores)

# Print the mean
