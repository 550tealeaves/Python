# Now you have seen the benefits of scaling your data, you will use a pipeline to preprocess the music_df features and build a lasso regression model to predict a song's loudness.

# Import StandardScaler
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Create pipeline steps
steps = [("scaler", StandardScaler()),
         ("lasso", Lasso(alpha=0.5))]

# Instantiate the pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline(steps)
pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)

#Â Calculate and print R-squared
print(pipeline.score(X_test, y_test)) #0.6193523316282489



# Now you will bring together scaling and model building into a pipeline for cross-validation.

# Your task is to build a pipeline to scale features in the music_df dataset and perform grid search cross-validation using a logistic regression model with different values for the hyperparameter C. The target variable here is "genre", which contains binary values for rock as 1 and any other genre as 0.

# Build the steps
steps = [("scaler", StandardScaler()),
         ("logreg", LogisticRegression())]
pipeline = Pipeline(steps)

# Create the parameter space
parameters = {"logreg__C": np.linspace(0.001, 1.0, 20)}
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, 
                                                    random_state=21)

# Instantiate the grid search object
cv = GridSearchCV(pipeline, param_grid=parameters)

# Fit to the training data
cv.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(cv.best_score_, "\n", cv.best_params_)


# 0.8425 
#  {'logreg__C': 0.1061578947368421}
