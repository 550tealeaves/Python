# Instantiate the model
# In the following set of exercises, you'll diagnose the bias and variance problems of a regression tree. The regression tree you'll define in this exercise will be used to predict the mpg consumption of cars from the auto dataset using all available features.

# Import train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Set SEED for reproducibility
SEED = 1

# Split the data into 70% train and 30% test
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=SEED)

# Instantiate a DecisionTreeRegressor dt
dt = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=4, min_samples_leaf=0.26, random_state=SEED)




# Evaluate the 10-fold CV error
# In this exercise, you'll evaluate the 10-fold CV Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) achieved by the regression tree dt that you instantiated in the previous exercise. Note that since cross_val_score has only the option of evaluating the negative MSEs, its output should be multiplied by negative one to obtain the MSEs. The CV RMSE can then be obtained by computing the square root of the average MSE.

# Compute the array containing the 10-folds CV MSEs
MSE_CV_scores = - cross_val_score(dt, X_train, y_train, cv=10, 
                                  scoring='neg_mean_squared_error', 
                                  n_jobs=-1) 

# Compute the 10-folds CV RMSE
RMSE_CV = (MSE_CV_scores.mean())**(1/2)

# Print RMSE_CV
print('CV RMSE: {:.2f}'.format(RMSE_CV))

# CV RMSE: 5.14



# Evaluate the training error
# You'll now evaluate the training set RMSE achieved by the regression tree dt that you instantiated in a previous exercise.

# Import mean_squared_error from sklearn.metrics as MSE
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error as MSE

# Fit dt to the training set
dt.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict the labels of the training set
y_pred_train = dt.predict(X_train)

# Evaluate the training set RMSE of dt
RMSE_train = (MSE(y_train, y_pred_train))**(1/2)

# Print RMSE_train
print('Train RMSE: {:.2f}'.format(RMSE_train))

# Train RMSE: 5.15




# Define the ensemble
# In the following set of exercises, you'll work with the Indian Liver Patient Dataset from the UCI Machine learning repository.

# In this exercise, you'll instantiate three classifiers to predict whether a patient suffers from a liver disease using all the features present in the dataset.

# Set seed for reproducibility
SEED=1

# Instantiate lr
lr = LogisticRegression(random_state=SEED)

# Instantiate knn
knn = KNN(n_neighbors=27)

# Instantiate dt
dt = DecisionTreeClassifier(min_samples_leaf=0.13, random_state=SEED)

# Define the list classifiers
classifiers = [('Logistic Regression', lr), ('K Nearest Neighbours', knn), ('Classification Tree', dt)]



# Evaluate individual classifiers
# In this exercise you'll evaluate the performance of the models in the list classifiers that we defined in the previous exercise. You'll do so by fitting each classifier on the training set and evaluating its test set accuracy.

# Iterate over the pre-defined list of classifiers
for clf_name, clf in classifiers:    
  
    # Fit clf to the training set
    clf.fit(X_train, y_train)    
  
    # Predict y_pred
    y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
    
    # Calculate accuracy
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
  
    # Evaluate clf's accuracy on the test set
    print('{:s} : {:.3f}'.format(clf_name, accuracy))


# Logistic Regression : 0.741
# K Nearest Neighbours : 0.701
# Classification Tree : 0.707




# Better performance with a Voting Classifier
# Finally, you'll evaluate the performance of a voting classifier that takes the outputs of the models defined in the list classifiers and assigns labels by majority voting.

# Import VotingClassifier from sklearn.ensemble
from sklearn.ensemble import VotingClassifier

# Instantiate a VotingClassifier vc 
vc = VotingClassifier(estimators=classifiers)     

# Fit vc to the training set
vc.fit(X_train, y_train)   

# Evaluate the test set predictions
y_pred = vc.predict(X_test)

# Calculate accuracy score
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print('Voting Classifier: {:.3f}'.format(accuracy))

# Voting Classifier: 0.764
