	• If condition is true, python executes the code only 1 time
	• While loop 
		○ Executes code inside if condition is true
		○ Will continue to execute the code repeatedly 
	• Similar syntax as if statement
	• When to use it
		○ Numerically calculating model
		○ Repeating action until condition is met
	• If there is a condition that evaluates to False, then the while loop stops running


	• When the while loop keeps running, it disconnects the session
	• Interrupt the loop with Ctrl + C
